This is a short-hand assignment for MyWays Company.

This project is designed to check the front-end capabilities therefore I haven't hooked it up with any database.
At the front-end, I have utilized ReactJS as my framework to maintain the state and functionality of the project.
In ReactJS , I have used technologies like :
    - React Router
    - React Functional Components with hooks
    - React Icons

This project is mobile-friendly as well and is hosted on github static pages platform.
